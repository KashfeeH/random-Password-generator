# Module 5: random-Password-generator

## Description

This week's challenge was to create a random password generator using vanilla javaScript. This is the first time when all three HTML, CSS and JavaScript came together to
create a solution that can be used in the real world scenario. A lot was learnt from this lesson for example functions, how to pass functions, returning items from each functions and using returned array as paramters in other functions. At the end, I still maintain a lot of practise is needed to actually understand the ways I can come up with a solution especially
in JavaScript.
